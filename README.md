# Thera AI 🧠✨

Thera AI is an experimental project built with [Jaclang](https://jaclang.org/) that explores AI-driven reasoning and interactive agents.  
This repo contains the `thera_ai.jac` program, which serves as the foundation for future AI-enhanced applications.
Meet Thera AI, your onestop therapist AI, with embedded openai api key, this model guides you through tough times. Also a bonus is inside Thera Tutor😁😁🫡👌
